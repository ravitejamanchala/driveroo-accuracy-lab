// Puzzles: short drives through the trickiest real layouts, graded Easy → Hardest.
// Same shape as a lesson (see course.js) plus `tier`, an optional `yield` event (traffic timed to arrive
// from your right) and optional `callouts` (examiner instructions for places the route builder can't
// describe, such as a one-way gyratory). Add a puzzle here; tools/split_areas.mjs gives it its own map area.
